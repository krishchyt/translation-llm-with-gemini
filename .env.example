# --- Google Cloud Configuration ---
# Replace with your actual Google Cloud Project ID
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-gcp-project-id"

# Replace with the Google Cloud region you want to use (e.g., us-central1, europe-west1)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"

# --- LLM Configuration (for Client) ---
# Optional: Specify the default Gemini model the client should use for orchestration/chat.
# Models like gemini-2.0-flash is a good choice.
# The server tools use specific models defined in gemini_server.py.
# LLM_MODEL_NAME="gemini-2.0-flash"

# --- Authentication ---
# Authentication to Google Cloud is typically handled via Application Default Credentials (ADC).
# Ensure you have authenticated by running:
# gcloud auth application-default login
# The GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable can also be used to point to a service account key file,
# but ADC is generally preferred for local development and Cloud environments.
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
